Recursion:
When a function call itself in the program again and again.

# Steps in Recurion (Example- Calculate a^b using Recursion)
1. Find the base case. (a^0 = 1 (base case were input does not enter in the recursion call))
2. Find the relation between the problem and subproblems. (a^b = a^b-1 x a (Recursion Leap of Faith))
3. Generalise the relation.


Recursion Leap of Faith: 
Don't enter in the Subproblems
